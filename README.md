# Migration Reporting Tool (Birds)

#### Considering observations provided by users (e.g., messages posted on a social network) or various sensors, develop an "intelligent" Web system capable to generate in real-time [an interactive map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Develop) regarding the migrations performed by various entities (birds, humans, robots, extraterrestrial beings) in a specific context (season, working, politic factors, calamity). Considering observations provided by users (e.g., messages posted on a social network) or various sensors, develop an "intelligent" Web system capable to generate in real-time an interactive map regarding the migrations performed by various entities (birds, humans, robots, extraterrestrial beings) in a specific context (season, working, politic factors, calamity). A migration-related event could be directly reported – in conjunction to the GPS info + optional (meta)data – into the implemented platform or by using #mig-here hashtag on an existing social Web application (Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo). Several useful statistics and visualizations about the migratory habits of specific species – including information on [geographical areas](http://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html), [climate](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#climate-weather), seasons, user comments/images/videos, etc. – should be offered by a SPARQL endpoint – possibly enhanced by additional knowledge provided by DBpedia and/or Wikidata. Visit also [Migration Data Portal](https://www.migrationdataportal.org/). Bonus: adopting a [stream processing](https://manuzhang.github.io/awesome-streaming/) approach.
